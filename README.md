Resources for Modeling for Data Science

*Modeling for Data Science* is the working title of an approach to statistical modeling that is rooted in data science and machine learning as well as in traditional regression techniques. This is intended to be the successor to the 2nd edition of *Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach*, which was released in 2011.

This repository contains an R package with data sets, shiny apps, and utility functions used in the books, demonstrations, exercises, etc. Not all of these are intended for direct use by students, but rather as support for those resources that will be directly used.
